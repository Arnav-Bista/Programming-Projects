# Break-Even

##Whats Break-Even?

Break-Even is a full GUI Break Even Grapher coded using Python. It plots a graph with almost all the elements from a perfect Break-Even Graph along with various useful information at its side.



This is just a Python scripy I programmed in my freetime. 
I gained the inspiration and the idea when we started studying Finance in Business Management (IB) and started looking at Break Even Graphs

Manually Drawing graphs seemed quite dull and boring. So I thought, why not make life easier?
